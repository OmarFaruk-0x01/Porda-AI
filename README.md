# Welcome to PORDA AI!
Introducing Porda Ai an innovative application.
Everyday AI companion designed for Muslim community to empower them maintain modesty in the digital realm by blurring and covering Non-Mahram and Haram objects (NSFW), directly on screen.

## About the Project
The project prevents to looking unwanted content one does not wish to see. The application places a cover directly on the object on the screen in real-time. This flexibility enables users to adapt the application to their specific needs, preferences, and cultural sensitivities. It offers high benefits for Muslim communities by allowing users to prevent the display of content that may be considered inappropriate or offensive according to Islamic principles. This can help individuals adhere to their religious beliefs and maintain a more positive and sacred digital environment.

## How Porda Ai works?
- Captures data from the window.
- Detects objects within the captured data.
- Generates an overlay box or applies blur directly onto the screen.

- Full Offline functionality (Dosen't communicate to internet)
- Works on anywhere, in any window, browser facebook, youtube, videoplayer.
- System Tray integration
- Auto Start Up
- Auto Sleep Mode, Audo Active Mode
- Bug fixes
- Improved accuracy
- App Inclusion/Exclusion
- Intel GPU support
- Auto-startup
- Shortcut keys
- Dataset creation
- Other optimizations

## Download and Installation
From google drive [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hUfZb6Ud025-CbYf9vOFYF5C_VoyHQZS/view?usp=sharing )
If download link dose not work then please contact me, I will response immediately inshaAllah.

## How to Use
- Download the app and click to open it.
- The app icon will appear in the system tray when a single app is opened. Avoid opening multiple apps simultaneously.
- Ok button disappare setting and starts working as settings, apply button applies setting while keeping the settings appare.
- Choose the object to detect (Male or Female) and select the cover type (black/white/bg-color/blur). blur level can also be adjusted.
- In the engine settings, select Intel GPU if you're using an Intel processor; otherwise, choose CPU.
- If you want to select GPU then add this app in Graphics Setting, graphics performance preference. Terminate the porda app and reopen and now select GPU.
- Click the Activate button and then click ok button. It may take 20-30 seconds to initialize, especially if using GPU.
After sucessfully setup the app will be working.
- Press F2 (default) to activate or deactivate the app. Double-click F2 to access settings.
- Adjust accuracy and other settings as needed. 
- To use the app regularly, enable the startup option and save settings.
- Shortcut keys are available for activation, deactivation, and creating datasets. Customize hotkeys as desired.
- If the app fails to detect objects accurately, create a dataset by pressing the hotkey. Data will be - Gathered in your selected folder and either send it to me for training or train the model yourself.
- Right-click on the system tray icon to exit or access other options.
- Check out other settings.
Don't hesitate to reach out for any queries or assistance.

## Limitations
- The network size is currently set at 416x416, so smaller objects (under 100px) may not be detected accurately in this version. Future updates will address this issue.
- The accuracy of the system ranges from 70% to 80% across various scenarios. Ongoing improvements will gradually enhance accuracy over time.
- While the software functions on any CPU, GPU support is currently limited to Intel OpenCL GPUs. Future -updates will extend compatibility to include late-model AMD GPUs and CUDA.
- The speed and effectiveness depend on your computer.
- Presently, the software is compatible only with Windows(10/11) operating systems. However, Linux compatibility can be tested using Bottle.
Any other observed limitations will be addressed in future updates, inshaAllah.

## The Next Update will be Published soon inshaAllah

## Help On this project
If you've found value in this project, your support can contribute to its present and future success.

I have been involved in all aspect of this project, from collecting and annotating datasets to training models and developing, testing the application. It took with long period of time for me. Surely With a larger dataset, we could achieve up to 98% accuracy.

You can assist by providing technical support, making donations, or offering suggestions for improvement. Any form of help will be greatly appreciated.

## Disclaimer
This is an experimental project and may have bugs that have not been fully addressed. By using this app, you acknowledge and accept this.
Use the app responsibly, and if you encounter any problems or issues, please report them to the project's issue tracker.
Note: This app was Tested on many computers in long time.
