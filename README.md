## About the Project

The project prevents to seeing unwanted content one does not wish to see. The application places a cover directly on the object on the screen in real-time. This flexibility enables users to adapt the application to their specific needs, preferences, and cultural sensitivities. It offers potential benefits for Muslim communities by allowing users to prevent the display of content that may be considered inappropriate or offensive according to Islamic principles. This can help individuals adhere to their religious beliefs and maintain a more positive and sacred digital environment.
